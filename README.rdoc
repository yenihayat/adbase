First clone repository to your local directory,

  git clone http://github.com/yenihayat/adbase.git

Then install missing gems required by AdBase;

  bundle install

After setting up db params in <tt>database.yml</tt>, create db and run migrations.

  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate

And to create default user and populate states;

  rake db:seed

Default urls set in <tt>config/config.yml</tt> and <tt>public/assets/ad.js</tt>. You may need to change them.

That's all! Now you can login with default user credentials;
